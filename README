ta: Using trashbox instead of dangerous `rm'

2007-2011 (C) Toshio Ito


ta is a simple Perl script that throws away files specified as
arguments into a "trashbox".  Since the thrown-away files are just
moved, you can restore these files lator unlike the dangerous 'rm'
command.

- Trashbox directories can be configured per-storage-device basis.
- ta does NOT conform to freedesktop.org trash specification.

See the script itself for more information.
